# sep769-deep-learning-project (Group 2)
SEP 769 (Cyber Physical Systems) Deep Learning Project, Project 3 - Aerial Perspective Object Detection (Group 2)

Our final code submission is the main branch of the "DeepLearningProject_Group2.ipynb" file. It includes model exploration, model development, training, and demonstrates functionality of our final trained model. Our trained model is the main branch of "DLP_Group2_model.h5".

The final cell of our code submission, titled "Running Final Model," demonstrates fulfilment of the 3 project requirements. The final cell loads our trained model, outputs performance metrics, displays segmentation masks, and shows examples of our collision detection algorithm.
